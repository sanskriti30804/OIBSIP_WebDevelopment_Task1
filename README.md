# OIBSIP_WebDevelopment_Task1
Task 1 of level 2 under Oasis Infobyte Internship Program
 [Calculator]
 ##  Objective
Created a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to perform fundamental arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a responsive and interactive UI.

##  Tools Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS Grid for layout)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- Visual Studio Code

##  Steps Performed
1. Designed the calculator layout using HTML and arranged buttons using CSS Grid.
2. Styled the interface for clarity and responsiveness using CSS.
3. Added a display screen to show input and results.
4. Used JavaScript to:
   - Capture button clicks using `eventListeners`
   - Handle input validation using `if-else` conditions
   - Perform arithmetic operations using standard operators
   - Update the display in real time with results
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., multiple operations, divide by zero)

## Outcome
A fully functional and visually appealing calculator that:
- Performs real-time operations
- Has a clear display screen
- Uses CSS Grid to neatly align buttons
- Can be used for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
